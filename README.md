Create a schema named “device” in MySQL. 

Change this line according to your own settings: db = pymysql.connect(host="localhost", user="root", password="", database="device")

Run the mysql_db.py in the terminal to create the tables. Then, open the insert_db.txt and insert the prepared data into the schema.

There are two costumes for you to test. (You could find them in the customer table)
1) Name: John Doe, Password: 123456
2) Name: Jane Smith, Password: 123456

Finally, open the main.py (python main.py) and run it on the terminal! 
It will show something like: Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
